### Heart Trail Animation

This is a simple animation of a heart trail using the p5.js library. The heart trail is created by drawing a heart shape at the mouse position every frame. The heart shape is created by drawing two circles and two bezier curves. The heart trail is then faded out by drawing a transparent rectangle over the entire canvas every frame.
